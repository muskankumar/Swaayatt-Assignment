        <h1>About the Company</h1>
        <h5 class="slideInLeft spacing-1 mt-1 w-80 mx-auto">
          Swaayatt Robots is one of the few Indian startups working on solving
          the autonomous challenges from a pure algorithmic point of view. The
          team makes use of reinforcement learning(RL) for learning various
          navigation policies to allow autonomous vehicles to deal with both the
          stochastic and adversarial traffic scenarios. For example, their
          multi-agent intent analysis and negotiation framework is a multi-RL
          agent framework which allows autonomous vehicles to negotiate tight
          dynamic roads, at both low and high speeds. They have also developed
          perception algorithmic frameworks that help autonomous vehicles
          perceive without LiDARs and RADARs, both during the day and at night.
          According to the company, their perception algorithms, based on
          end-to-end deep learning, are highly computationally efficient
          compared to the existing state-of-the-art deep learning systems.

          Sanjeev initiated his research in autonomous navigation in unknown
          environments in January 2009, when he was an undergrad student at IIT
          Roorkee. Since 2014, his research has spanned across several areas of
          theoretical computer science and applied mathematics, focusing on
          applications in autonomous driving, including deep learning, computer
          vision, SLAM, and visual odometry.His research at Swaayatt Robots, to
          enable autonomous driving in environments as difficult as in India,
          has been covered by both the national and international media, on
          several occasions.
